# Sends fresh HyperCore prices to Elysium by calling Beacon.push() on HyperEVM.
#
# Nothing depends on this script. Anyone can call push() from any wallet; this only
# saves working out the fees by hand. It cannot change what the prices say: the
# Beacon reads them from HyperCore itself, in the same transaction.
#
# What one push pays for, all in HYPE on HyperEVM:
#   - a submission fee, so Elysium accepts the message (quoted by Elysium's Inbox)
#   - the Elysium gas that runs Receiver.update() when the message lands, 65-78 s later on testnet
# Anything left over is refunded to the sender's address on Elysium.
#
# Needs Foundry (cast) and jq.
#
# Usage:
#   HYPEREVM_RPC=... ELYSIUM_RPC=... BEACON=0x... PERPS=0,1 script/push.sh
#   INTERVAL=60 ... script/push.sh      # push again every 60 seconds
#
# Signing uses cast's own keystore settings, so the key never appears here:
#   ETH_KEYSTORE          path to a keystore file, or
#   ETH_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT  name of a key in ~/.foundry/keystores (cast wallet import)
#   ETH_PASSWORD          path to a file holding its password
#
# Any failed step stops the script. Nothing is retried or skipped quietly.

# covers that; the unused part comes back as the refund above.
